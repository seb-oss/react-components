This is a set of react components some of which are based on SEB's bootstrap. The plan for this project is to increase and improve components for future usage.

- The package name: `@sebgroup/react-components`
- The package documentation: [Documentation](https://sebgroup.github.io/react-components)
- The package sourcecode: [Github Source Code](https://github.com/sebgroup/react-components)
- NPM package: [@sebgroup/react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sebgroup/react-components)

## Minimum requirements

This version of components has been developed with:

-   React `^16.12`
-   Typescript `^3.7`
-   SEB Bootstrap `^5.1`

## Installation

You should be able to install the NPM package.

```bash
npm install @sebgroup/react-components --save
```

This project is based on SEB Bootstrap which includes `fonts`, `colors` and `variables`, to make sure everything works fine, please install these dependencies on your project:

```bash
npm install @sebgroup/bootstrap --save
```

Then make sure you add the Main SEB bootstrap package in your main style.SCSS or index.ts as follows
`@import '~@sebgroup/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';`.

For `Visual Studio Code` users, please install the [recommended plugins](.vscode/extensions.json)

## Development

This project uses `prettier` for a more consistent (less annoying) coding. We are using 4 different builds for this project. The `src` folder is where the actual components exist with all their necessary dependencies. and `develop` folder is where we develop and test those components. Unit tests are based on `jest` and `enzyme`.

1. Development: `npm start`
2. Check formatting rules, Compile components and Create Docs folder: `npm run build`
3. Build and create the Documentation pages only: `npm run docs`
4. To run the unit tests, run: `npm test`
5. To run a unit test for a specific component you have to pass the name of the component, example: `npm test Button`. It can also be chained with multiple specific components, e.g. `npm test Button RadioGroup`
6. To commit your changes run: `npm run commit` and follow the steps

## Usage

For performance benefits we are not combining all the components into single Index rather they are chunked into their subpackage. Therefore, to use a component, you need to import the `Component` submodule from the `dist` folder, in whichever Class you want to use it. Here is a sample of how to import a `Button` component in a page.

```javascript
import { Button } from "@sebgroup/react-components/dist/Button";

const Comp = () => {
    const onClick = (e) => {
        console.log("Im Clicked");
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <Button label="a button" onClick={onClick} />
        </div>
    );
}

export default Comp;
```
